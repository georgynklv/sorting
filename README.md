# sorting

#some important definitons 

//Algorithms - a finite sequence of well-defined operations, which given input will produce in finite time a required output 

//Data Structures - structured memory space and the set of operations and actions for accessing and manipulating such memory space

//Sorting - order a given set according to order relation

//Selection sort 
set through direct selection

//Idea 
-Look for the smallest or largest element 
-Replace it with the first elememt 
-Move to the second element 
-Repeat with the rest array 

//Complexity 
(N-1)+(N-2)+(N-3)...3+2+1=N(N-1)/2  that's formula from math. series 
So, at infinity O(N^2)
